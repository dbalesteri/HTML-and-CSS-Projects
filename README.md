# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains simple one page websites utilizing HTML, CSS, and some JS. I have more finalized projects highlighted below. The other small projects in folderes were a part of learning and demonstrating simple concepts.

### Main Projects:

* [One Page Website Lightbox](#One_Page_Website_Lightbox)
* [Project Website](#project-website)
* [Website Portfolio](#website-portfolio)
* [Academy Cinemas](#academy-cinema)

* <a name="project-website"></a>Project Website:
  This is also a simple one page site, similar to the one above except without a lightbox. Different theme to show about the same concept. The lightbox was an expansion on this page, hence this one had a more generic name to start.
