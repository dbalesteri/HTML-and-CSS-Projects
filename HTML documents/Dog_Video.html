        <p>Here is a linked video informing of dog behavior! </p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bg_gGguwzg">Link to a video about dogs</a>
        <blockqutoe cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bg_gGguwzg">This video goes over very BASIC dog body language. 
        This video is meant to give a brief overview of what it means when your dog does a certain behaviour. 
        Dog communication is one of the most misunderstood part of dogs and humans and causes tremendous amounts of problem for both species. 
        If you can take a few parts of this video and apply it to your life and better understanding your dog you will have a more fulfilled relationship with your four legged pal.</blockqutoe>
